Kitchen Management System

## Vision

MiseOS is a digital management platform designed for professional kitchens. It streamlines the workflow from a cook's initial dish proposal to the final guest menu. By digitizing the planning phase, the system replaces manual paper trails and static documents with a dynamic, multilingual hub for kitchen operations.

The name references "mise en place" — the culinary principle of having everything in its place before service.

## Problem Statement

- Currently, menu planning in many canteens relies on fragmented, analog processes. This creates several operational challenges:

- Manual Documentation: Chefs spend significant time manually typing handwritten notes into Word templates to create printable menus.

- Communication Gaps: Dish proposals from various sections (Hot, Cold, Salad, Bakery) are often communicated verbally or via loose notes, leading to a lack of overview.

- Static Information: Printed menus are difficult to update and provide a poor experience for international guests due to the manual effort required for translation.

MiseOS solves these issues by providing a centralized digital workspace where data is entered once and used throughout the entire workflow.

## Core Features

- Section-Based Planning: Line cooks can submit weekly proposals for their specific stations (Hot, Cold, Salad, Bakery).

- Management Dashboard: The Head Chef can review, edit, and approve all proposals in a single matrix view, eliminating the need for external document editors.

- Ingredient Request System: A built-in flow where ingredient needs are linked directly to approved dishes and aggregated into a shopping list.

- Automated Translation: Batch translation of the weekly menu via an external API (Danish to English) to support international environments.

- Public Menu Access: A digital guest view that displays the current menu, including allergen information and language toggles.
